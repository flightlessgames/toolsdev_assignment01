Brown has relieved an police officer of his police powers after he extended his middle fingers towards protesters last Thursday, according to a Chicago Police Department (CPD) statement issued Tuesday.
"The officer used a vulgar, offensive gesture directed at a member of the public while on duty and in uniform.
The member will be limited to administrative duties at the direction of the Superintendent," it said, describing the officer's conduct as "unbecoming."
A few have gone further -- in one week there were at least nine instances of police using excessive force caught on camera.

Austrian architects will transform Hitler's birthplace into a police station - Oscar Holland

Rihanna, Ariana Grande and more artists sign open letter calling for police reform in New York - Chloe Melas
(CNN) Some of the biggest names in the music industry are joining the call for reform of policing in New York.
Rihanna, Ariana Grande, Billie Eilish, Justin Bieber, Post Malone, Meek Mill, the Jonas Brothers and many more signed an open letter on Monday, asking New York legislators to repeal section 50-a of New York State's Civil Rights Law.
We must hold accountable those who violate the oath to protect and serve, and find justice for those who are victim to their violence," the open letter reads in part.
New York statute 50-A blocks that full transparency, shielding a history of police misconduct from public scrutiny, making it harder to seek justice and bring about reform.
The petition and open letter comes in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis after former police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.

"I even got some pushback for this, which you know I don't care what people think about me or what they say about me, but I made a statement that my children fear police," Cannon told "Access Hollywood" about what he called the "stay alive" talk many black parents have with their children regarding interacting with police.
"It's a real statement."

Defunding the police isn't the answer - Opinion Jason C. Johnson, James A. Gagliano
Jason C. Johnson is president of the Law Enforcement Legal Defense Fund (LELDF), a nonprofit educational organization that defends accused law enforcement officers, and he served as deputy commissioner of the Baltimore (Maryland) Police Department between 2016 and 2018.
He is a CNN law enforcement analyst and adjunct assistant professor in criminal justice and homeland security matters at St. John's University in Queens, New York.
Qualitatively improving the policing profession, not disassembling it, is the best means to prevent such senseless tragedies from ever happening again.
Nothing less than a concerted federal effort must commence to build and shape a cohesive, effective, consistent and professional system of state and local law enforcement agencies.
Local law enforcement organizations simply cannot attract enough minimally qualified candidates.

I was a black FBI agent. White cops didn't always see me as equal - Opinion Andre Mcgregor
All black cops have their own version of these same stories shaped by peer cops around them.
Changing community sentiments toward law enforcement starts with revamping how we select law enforcement officers in the first place.
The FBI has 400 black agents among its 13,000 agents worldwide, giving them 3% of black FBI agents for a country with a black population of 13%.
In 2014 when Michael Brown was killed, Ferguson, Missouri, had a police force of 50 white officers with three black officers; the equivalent of 5% of black officers for a town with a black population of 67%.
Until last summer, five years later, Ferguson's Police Department had 18 black officers among its 39 sworn officers - a ten-fold increase in black officers which, among other progressive changes to policing, reduced overall violent crime by over 20%.

Trump Falsely Targets Buffalo Protester, 75, as ‘Antifa Provocateur’ - Alan Feuer
Near Buffalo, however, the idea that Mr. Gugino was one of them struck many as absurd.
Oh, heavens no,” said Judy Metzger, 85, who lives near Mr. Gugino in Amherst, a suburb of the city.
“Martin is a very gentle, a very pleasant person.”Born in Buffalo, Mr. Gugino spent most of his working life in Cleveland, where he specialized in creating computer databases, his friends and colleagues said.
John Washington, 35, first met Mr. Gugino at an Occupy Buffalo event in 2011 when both men took to the streets of Niagara Square, the same place where Mr. Gugino was shoved by the police last week.
Mr. Washington was immediately struck by the older man’s vitality and youthful demeanor, and by his command of issues that ranged from energy efficiency to the military prison at Guantánamo Bay.

Trump, GOP Seek to Use Police Defunding Issue Against Democrats - Catherine Lucey, Natalie Andrews
President Trump and Republicans are building a plank of their campaign strategy on the push to “defund the police,” casting it as a dangerous Democratic move that threatens public safety, as likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his allies distance themselves from the movement.
Facing sagging poll numbers and following months of crisis, the Trump campaign and congressional Republicans see political opportunity in the calls for defunding police departments coming from activists and some progressive leaders.

Immunity Doctrine Often Shields Police From Lawsuits - Jess Bravin, Brent Kendall
WASHINGTON—Three days after George Floyd was killed in the custody of Minneapolis police, the Supreme Court’s justices met privately to consider a raft of long-pending appeals asking them to review a legal doctrine that makes it difficult for many victims of abusive policing to sue the perpetrators.
The timing was coincidence, and the court has taken no action on the petitions.
But the multitude of cases—including one from Minneapolis—underscores the power of qualified immunity, a rule the Supreme Court recognized in 1967,...

What Is Kettling, the Police Technique Used in George Floyd Protests? - Valerie Bauerlein, Scott Calvert

Civil-rights leaders say the tactic, known as kettling, has worsened chaos rather than defused it.
Peaceful protesters are commonly being boxed in with or without troublemakers in tense conditions, with police sometimes deploying tear gas and rubber...
